Algorithm for Finding an Induced Subgraph with Minimum Degree Constraint
Problem Breakdown
We need to find an induced subgraph where each node in has a degree of at least . This means we must iteratively remove nodes that do not satisfy this degree condition, ensuring that we reach a solution in time.
Key Observations
	1.	Nodes with Degree < Cannot Be in the Final Subgraph
Any node with degree less than is removed because it violates the constraint.
	2.	Degree Reduction Process
When we remove a node, the degree of its neighbors decreases, potentially causing more nodes to fall below the threshold. This suggests an iterative pruning process.
Algorithm
	1.	Compute Initial Degrees
	•	Compute the degree of each node in  O(V + E) .
	2.	Use a Queue or Stack for Efficient Node Removal
	•	Maintain a queue (or stack) of nodes with degree  < \frac{E}{V} .
	•	Iteratively remove nodes and update the degrees of their neighbors.
	•	If a neighbor’s degree drops below  \frac{E}{V} , enqueue it for removal.
	3.	Terminate When No More Nodes Need to Be Removed
	•	The remaining nodes form the desired induced subgraph.
Pseudocode
```python
def find_induced_subgraph(G, V, E):
    # Step 1: Compute initial degrees
    degree = {node: 0 for node in G}  
    for node in G:
        degree[node] = len(G[node])  # Count edges for each node
    
    # Step 2: Identify nodes with degree < E/V
    threshold = E / V
    queue = [node for node in G if degree[node] < threshold]

    # Step 3: Iteratively remove nodes
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop()
        for neighbor in G[node]:
            degree[neighbor] -= 1  # Reduce neighbor's degree
            if degree[neighbor] == threshold - 1:  # Just dropped below threshold
                queue.append(neighbor)
        del degree[node]  # Remove node from the graph

    # Step 4: Return the remaining induced subgraph
    subgraph = {node: [nbr for nbr in G[node] if nbr in degree] for node in degree}
    return subgraph
Complexity Analysis
	•	Computing Degrees:
	•	Initializing the Queue:
	•	Processing Each Node Once:
	•	Updating Degrees (Each Edge Processed Once):
	•	Total Complexity:
Final Thoughts
	•	This is a greedy pruning algorithm that ensures we remove only necessary nodes.
	•	The use of a queue ensures efficient removal and neighbor updates.
	•	The final result is an induced subgraph where all nodes meet the degree requirement.

To solve the problem of finding an induced subgraph where each node has a degree of at least \( \frac{E}{V} \), we can follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Graph Basics**: A graph \( G \) consists of \( V \) vertices (nodes) and \( E \) edges connecting these vertices.
2. **Induced Subgraph**: An induced subgraph is formed by selecting a subset of vertices from \( G \) and including all the edges from \( G \) that connect pairs of vertices in the subset.
3. **Degree of a Node**: The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
4. **Objective**: We need to find an induced subgraph where every node has a degree of at least \( \frac{E}{V} \).

### Initial Observations

- **Average Degree**: The value \( \frac{E}{V} \) represents the average degree of the nodes in the graph.
- **Nodes to Exclude**: Nodes with degrees less than \( \frac{E}{V} \) cannot be part of the desired subgraph because they don't meet the degree requirement.

### Algorithm Design

The algorithm involves iteratively removing nodes that do not meet the degree requirement and updating the degrees of the remaining nodes accordingly. Here's how it can be implemented:

1. **Calculate the Threshold**: Determine the threshold degree \( k = \frac{E}{V} \).
2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use a queue to keep track of nodes that need to be removed.
   - Maintain an array to store the current degree of each node.
3. **Identify Nodes Below Threshold**:
   - Iterate through all nodes and enqueue those with a degree less than \( k \).
4. **Remove Nodes and Update Degrees**:
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.
   - Remove this node from the graph.
   - Decrease the degree of its neighbors by 1.
   - If any neighbor's degree falls below \( k \) after this update, enqueue it.
5. **Termination**: The process terminates when no more nodes can be removed (i.e., the queue is empty).
6. **Result**: The remaining nodes form the induced subgraph where each node has a degree of at least \( k \).

### Pseudocode

```python
def find_induced_subgraph(V, E, adjacency_list):
    # Calculate the threshold degree
    k = E / V
    
    # Initialize degree array
    degree = [0] * V
    for node in range(V):
        degree[node] = len(adjacency_list[node])
    
    # Initialize queue with nodes having degree < k
    queue = []
    for node in range(V):
        if degree[node] < k:
            queue.append(node)
    
    # Process the queue
    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        # Remove current_node from the graph
        for neighbor in adjacency_list[current_node]:
            degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if degree[neighbor] == k - 1:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        # Mark current_node as removed
        degree[current_node] = -1
    
    # Collect remaining nodes
    induced_subgraph_nodes = [node for node in range(V) if degree[node] >= k]
    
    # Construct the induced subgraph
    induced_subgraph = {node: [] for node in induced_subgraph_nodes}
    for node in induced_subgraph_nodes:
        for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:
            if neighbor in induced_subgraph:
                induced_subgraph[node].append(neighbor)
    
    return induced_subgraph
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Threshold Calculation**: We compute \( k = \frac{E}{V} \) to determine the minimum required degree.
2. **Degree Initialization**: We create an array to store the degree of each node by counting the number of neighbors.
3. **Queue Initialization**: We populate the queue with nodes that have degrees less than \( k \).
4. **Queue Processing**: We process each node in the queue:
   - Remove the node from consideration.
   - Decrease the degree of its neighbors.
   - If any neighbor's degree falls below \( k \), add it to the queue.
5. **Result Compilation**: After processing, nodes not marked as removed (degree not set to -1) form the induced subgraph.
6. **Subgraph Construction**: We build the subgraph by including only the edges between the remaining nodes.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Initialization**: Calculating degrees takes \( O(V + E) \).
- **Queue Operations**: Each node and edge is processed at most once, leading to \( O(V + E) \) operations.
- **Overall Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \( O(V + E) \) time, meeting the problem's requirement.

### Example

Consider a graph with \( V = 5 \) nodes and \( E = 6 \) edges:

```
Adjacency List:
0: [1, 2]
1: [0, 2, 3]
2: [0, 1, 3, 4]
3: [1, 2, 4]
4: [2, 3]
```

- **Threshold**: \( k = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2 \). Since degrees are integers, we consider \( k = 2 \).
- **Initial Degrees**: [2, 3, 4, 3, 2]
- **Queue Initialization**: Nodes with degree < 2: None.
- **Induced Subgraph**: All nodes remain since none have degree less than 2.

If we modify the graph to have a node with degree 1:

```
Adjacency List:
0: [1]
1: [0, 2, 3]
2: [1, 3, 4]
3: [1, 2, 4]
4: [2, 3]
```

- **Threshold**: \( k = 2 \).
- **Initial Degrees**: [1, 3, 3, 3, 2]
- **Queue Initialization**: Node 0 has degree < 2.
- **Processing**:
  - Remove node 0.
  - Decrease degree of node 1 to 2.
  - Node 1's degree is now 2 (not < 2), so it's not added to the queue.
- **Induced Subgraph**: Nodes [1, 2, 3, 4] with edges between them.

### Conclusion

This algorithm efficiently identifies the largest induced subgraph where each node meets the specified degree requirement by iteratively removing nodes that do not satisfy the condition. Its linear time complexity makes it suitable for large graphs.

Algorithm for Maximum Path Sum in an Grid
(a) Precise Algorithm Description (Pseudocode)
We use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum sum path to reach cell . The recurrence relation follows:
where:
	•	 is the sum from the cell above (if it exists),
	•	 is the sum from the left cell (if it exists),
	•	We take the maximum to ensure the best path.
Pseudocode
def max_path_sum(grid):
    """
    Given an N x M grid, find the maximum sum path from (0,0) to (N-1,M-1),
    moving only right or down.

    Input: 2D list `grid` of size N x M
    Output: Maximum sum achievable from (0,0) to (N-1,M-1)
    """
    N = len(grid)
    M = len(grid[0])

    # Create DP table, initialized with 0s
    dp = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]

    # Initialize first cell
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    # Fill first row (can only come from the left)
    for j in range(1, M):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]

    # Fill first column (can only come from above)
    for i in range(1, N):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]

    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(1, M):
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    # The maximum sum path is in the bottom-right corner
    return dp[N - 1][M - 1]
(b) Intuition Behind the Algorithm
	1.	Break the problem into subproblems
	•	We define dp[i][j] as the best path sum to reach cell (i, j).
	•	The only possible moves are right and down, so we consider the best path leading to (i, j) from either:
	•	The left cell dp[i][j-1]
	•	The top cell dp[i-1][j]
	•	The optimal substructure lets us build solutions from previously computed values.
	2.	Base Cases
	•	dp[0][0] starts as grid[0][0], since that’s our initial position.
	•	The first row can only be reached from the left.
	•	The first column can only be reached from above.
	3.	Iterative Computation
	•	We fill the DP table row by row, ensuring each cell gets its optimal sum by choosing the best previous step.
	4.	Final Answer
	•	The bottom-right cell dp[N-1][M-1] contains the maximum path sum.
(c) Correctness Justification
The algorithm follows dynamic programming principles:
	•	Optimal Substructure: The best path to (i, j) relies on the best path to (i-1, j) and (i, j-1), which are optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.
	•	Overlapping Subproblems: The value at dp[i][j] is reused in multiple computations for cells below and to the right.
	•	Base Cases Handle Edges Correctly: The first row and first column are initialized correctly to handle edge constraints.
Thus, by filling the DP table from top-left to bottom-right, we guarantee an optimal solution.
(d) Running Time of the Algorithm
	•	The algorithm fills an table.
	•	Each cell dp[i][j] is computed in constant time .
	•	There are cells, so the total complexity is:
(e) Justification of the Running-Time Analysis
	•	Looping Over the Grid: We iterate through the entire grid exactly once.
	•	Constant Work per Cell: For each dp[i][j], we only perform an addition and a max() operation, both of which take .
	•	No Extra Space Used Beyond : The DP table itself is the only extra storage.
This results in an efficient solution, which is the best possible for this problem.

(2,3)
3
max(21, 22) + 3 = 25

Final Answer:
max_path_sum(grid) = 25
Alternative Optimization (Space )
Instead of a full DP table, we can optimize space to by storing only the current row and previous row.
def max_path_sum_optimized(grid):
    N, M = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [0] * M  # 1D DP array

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(M):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                dp[j] = grid[i][j]
            elif i == 0:
                dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + grid[i][j]
            elif j == 0:
                dp[j] = dp[j] + grid[i][j]
            else:
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - 1]) + grid[i][j]

    return dp[M - 1]
This reduces space complexity from to while maintaining time.
Final Answer Summary
	•	Algorithm: DP with recurrence .
	•	Time Complexity: .
	•	Space Complexity: (can be optimized to ).
	•	Correctness: Ensured by optimal substructure and bottom-up computation.

DeepSeek:

To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where movement is restricted to right or down directions, we can use dynamic programming (DP) for an efficient solution. The key insight is that the maximum sum to reach any cell (i, j) depends on the maximum sums from the cell above (i-1, j) and the cell to the left (i, j-1).

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Create a 1D DP array to store the maximum sum values for the current row, initializing it with the values from the first row.
2. **First Row Handling**: Accumulate the sums from left to right for the first row since you can only move right.
3. **Subsequent Rows**: For each subsequent row:
   - Update the first column value by adding the current cell's value to the previous row's first column value (since you can only come from above).
   - For each subsequent column, update the DP value by taking the maximum of the value from the cell above (current DP value) and the cell to the left (previous DP value), then add the current cell's value.
4. **Result**: The last element of the DP array will hold the maximum sum path value.

### Solution Code

```python
def max_path_sum(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize DP array with the first row
    dp = [0] * m
    dp[0] = grid[0][0]
    for j in range(1, m):
        dp[j] = dp[j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Process remaining rows
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Update the first column
        dp[0] += grid[i][0]
        for j in range(1, m):
            dp[j] = grid[i][j] + max(dp[j], dp[j-1])
    
    return dp[-1]
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The DP array is initialized to store the cumulative sums of the first row. This is because the only way to traverse the first row is by moving right from the starting cell (0,0).
2. **First Row Processing**: Each cell in the first row is filled by adding the previous cell's cumulative sum to the current cell's value.
3. **Subsequent Rows Processing**: For each new row, the first column is updated by adding the current cell's value to the previous row's first column value. For other columns, each cell is updated by considering the maximum sum from either the cell above (from the DP array) or the cell to the left (from the current row's processing), then adding the current cell's value.
4. **Efficiency**: This approach uses a 1D DP array, reducing the space complexity to O(M) where M is the number of columns. The time complexity is O(N*M), which is optimal for this problem as it processes each cell exactly once.

This method efficiently computes the maximum path sum using dynamic programming with optimized space usage, ensuring it handles grids of all sizes effectively.


We say a binary tree has full levels if it has 2d nodes at depth d.
Given a proper binary tree in which every node has a value 1 larger than its depth
design an algorithm that finds the maximum-value tree with full levels included in it.
Return the root of this tree and its depth.
